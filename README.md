This is a newer set of sketches that I'm making, as I set out to explore the world of creating digital art.  

The ultimate goal for these sketches is to treat them as modules, along with some machine learning scripts, which will be able to be used with various 'main' scripts, which will automate running them and mixing them in combonations and set their parameters generatively.  

There are a series of older sketches I made using Vue- you can find that repository here (<a href='https://github.com/qozle/p5-sketch-book'>https://github.com/qozle/p5-sketch-book</a>).  I no longer maintain that repository.
